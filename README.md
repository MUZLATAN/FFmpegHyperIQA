 Evaluating Image Quality Based on HyperIQA
 # What is HyperIQA
 HyperIQA is a method for evaluating image quality. It is based on the idea that human vision system is more sensitive to high-frequency content than low-frequency content. Therefore, a metric that takes into account both low-frequency and high-frequency content is needed.for more infomation click here  [hyperIQA](https://github.com/SSL92/hyperIQA)
